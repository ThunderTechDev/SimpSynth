## 📝 Description

SimpSynth represents my personal journey into the realm of sound synthesis. Although its functionalities may seem humble, SimpSynth lays the groundwork for my venture into Swift and SwiftUI application development.

## 🎛️ 💻 Features and Technologies

SimpSynth encapsulates a series of features, each representing a hurdle overcome during my development journey:

- Playback of multiple MIDI notes 🎼: Accomplished by leveraging the "KEYBOARD" framework.
- Interactive volume controls 🎚️: Brought to life through a focused exploration of user interface design.
- Basic sound effects: The addition of Delay and Reverb effects enhances the simplicity of the Soundfont-file-derived audio, achieved with the AUDIOKITEX package.
- Waveform visualization: The visualization of the currently playing sound, realized using the AUDIOKITUI package.

Please note, the simplicity of SimpSynth offers the potential for future enhancements, including the addition of new sounds or octave-switching capabilities on the keyboard.


## 🏗️ Project Status

While SimpSynth is complete in line with the original vision, it stands as an open canvas for further enhancements and improvements, embodying the ongoing journey of learning.
