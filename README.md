📝 Description

SimpSynth represents a personal exploration into the world of sound synthesis. As a SwiftUI-based application, it stands as a testament to what can be achieved when curiosity meets determination. Despite its humble functionality, SimpSynth lays the foundation for my journey in Swift and SwiftUI application development.

##🎛️ Features

SimpSynth encapsulates a variety of features, each representing a challenge overcome during the development journey:

Playback of multiple MIDI notes 🎼: A core function that propels the heartbeat of SimpSynth.
Interactive volume controls 🎚️: Realized through a determined dive into user interface design.
Basic sound effects: Delay and Reverb, to add depth to the simple Soundfont-file-derived audio.
Waveform visualization: Showcases the currently playing sound, a feature that required a meticulous understanding of audio data handling.
Single octave keyboard operation: A simple yet effective functionality, made possible by the integration of the Keyboard library.
Please note, the modest scope of SimpSynth leaves room for potential enhancements such as additional sounds or octave-switching capabilities on the keyboard.

##💻 Technologies

SimpSynth has been crafted using the following technologies, each representing a significant learning curve:

Swift: The primary language that powered my journey through this project.
SwiftUI: Used for designing the user interface, it was both a challenge and a delight to learn and implement.
AudioKit: A robust framework that demanded an in-depth understanding for incorporating audio-related functionalities. Libraries such as AUDIOKITEX and AUDIOKITUI were utilized.
AVFoundation: Employed for MIDI sound playback, it added another layer of complexity to the learning process.
Keyboard: A graphical library integrated for keyboard functionalities. Understanding and implementing this library was a noteworthy experience.
🏗️ Project Status

SimpSynth is complete as per the initial vision but stands as an open canvas for further enhancements and improvements, embodying the never-ending learning process.
